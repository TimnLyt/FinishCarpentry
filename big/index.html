    <p> Something that most motoring enthusiasts know already, but many other people get wrong, the latest R35 GT-R is not a skyline. Previous iterations of the GT-R all bore the name of ‘Skyline’, however Nissan announced during the R35 launch event that the car would simply be called the Nissan GT-R (R35). The last car to have the Skyline name was the R35’s predecessor, the R34. </p>
    <p> When the Nissan GT-R R35 was being developed one of the goals was to create a 911 killer. The 2007 Porsche 911 Turbo was Nissan’s prey, which was widely regarded as one of the best sports cars of the time during the R35’s original launch. They wanted to beat the Porsche’s Nurburgring lap time and only launched the car once they were sure it was possible. The R35 not only did that, but it also outperformed much more expensive supercars and is still one of the fastest cars around the ‘Ring’ 10 years later. </p>
         
    
        
    <p> At the beginning of the 90’s Nissan wanted a car to compete in Group A racing championships. Rules stated that all cars must be road legal and existing production models. The previous GT-R was 16 years out of production and Nissan decided to bring the GT-R name back with the R32 GT-R. Nissan’s R32 managed to win every championship it entered in its first year and became an icon of the motoring world. The GT-R is still probably the most loved Japanese sports car to date. </p>
    <p> Originally the first Skyline cars were produced by Prince Motors. Prince Motors were a Japanese car manufacturer that was founded in 1955 and taken over by Datsun. Datsun then shoved a six cylinder engine into the Skyline body in 1969 and the Skyline GT-R was born. Later Datsun was renamed to Nissan. </p>
        
    <h2> Now it's time to show where all that power comes from! </h2>
    <p> We know that the R-35 was as fast as many supercars and hypercars when it launched (and today as well), but why was that? One of the reasons was the incredible gearbox that was as fast as the Ferrari Enzo’s. The GT-R and the Enzo can both shift in 150ms, however unlike the Enzo the GT-R’s gearbox can be driven in automatic mode and gives a smoother ride. The GT-R is a Ferrari eater that can then be taken on the shopping run. </p>
    <p> All of the GT-R cars are incredible, but the R35’s amazing engine is a work of art in itself. The R35’s 3.8 litre V6 engine is the most powerful engine Nissan has ever put in a production car. It produced approximately 473 bhp and 588Nm when it was launched back in 2007, but now produces 565 bhp and 637Nm. Another unbelievable fact is that only 13 master engineers are allowed to assemble the R35’s engine. These people are called Takumi. Lastly, each engine is mated to a custom gearbox that will only work with the specific engine. </p>

    <h3> About The POWER! </h3>
    <p> During the 90’s, Japanese car manufactures were under agreement to only produce cars with a maximum power output of 276 bhp. However the Rb26 found in the R32, R33 and R34 was quite a bit more powerful than that. When the R32 left the factory and hit the dynos, many people found that the engine was actually producing 330+ bhp. Not only were the Rb26 GT-R’s more powerful than expected, but the R35 was found to produce more horsepower than advertised by many magazines. </p>
    <p> When the car was first launched in the US, a comic called the GT-R was also introduced which also included the history of the GT-R namesake. </p>

        <h3> The Amazing GTR: </h3>

<!-- Below the figure is where you add the caption -->
        <ul>
            <li> MPG: 16 city / 22 highway </li>
            <li> Curb weight: 3,865 to 3,933 </li>
            <li> AWD </li>
            <li> 600 hp </li>
            <li> 3.8 L V6 </li>
            <li> MSRP: $115,000 </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Craftsmanship </h3>
        <p> Carefully crafting each part – thinking of the mind, body, and spirit of the customers who will use their products – is the spirit of the Takumi, a part of Japanese tradition. And that is the human soul in the Nissan GT-R, a supercar that could never be created in a factory that only pursues rationality. </p>
        <h3> Driving Dynamics </h3>
        <p> The Nissan GT-R’s rigid forged aluminum 20" wheels, manufactured by RAYS®, utilize knurling inside the wheels to help keep the tires from slipping around the wheels under heavy acceleration or braking. The wheels feature a machined finish, which provides a high-quality, high-performance look. </p>
        <h3> Transmission </h3>
        <p> The longer a shift takes, the less time power is being put to the ground. The GT-R’s sequential dual-clutch transmission can snap off lightning-quick gear changes in just 0.15 seconds when in R-Mode – almost as quickly as you can blink. </p>
        <h3> Aerodynamics </h3>
        <p> Relentless tuning of the GT-R’s aerodynamics creates an incredibly clean Coefficient of Drag of just 0.26 Cd. While you see a substantial, powerful supercar, to the wind, it punches through the air like a low-slung, mid-engine supercar. Pure aerodynamic alchemy. </p>
        <h3> Engine </h3>
        <p> Nissan challenged convention at every point of the Nissan GT-R’s development. Instead of a large, heavy engine thirsty for fuel, the Nissan GT-R is powered by an ideally sized, twin-turbocharged 3.8-L V6 that produces a prodigious 565 hp and equally immense 467 lb-ft of torque. Just as important as the engineering is the actual assembly, which is done by hand by a single master craftsman, whose signature you’ll find on a small but prominent plaque. </p>
